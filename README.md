# Dorm-Room-Assignment-Project

This project assigns students to dorm rooms using a Deferred Acceptance matching algorithm. It takes in student preferences and room data, applies constraints like budget limits and accessibility needs, and produces valid room assignments.

The goal is to simulate how a real university housing system could work while keeping the process fair and efficient.
